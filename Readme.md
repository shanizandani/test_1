# PyOperations
This repository contains Python modules for mathematical a



## Enum

### func_enum

This module provides an enum for the basic mathematical operations:
- `Operation` defines four basic mathematical operations:  ADD = 1
    SUBTRACT = 2
    SUM_OF_DIGITS = 3
    IS_PALINDROME = 4
    MY_ZIP = 5

## Usage

The functions can be used by importing them in your Python code.

Example:

from NUMBERS.simp import adding, subtracting
from NUMBERS.comp import sumofdigits, ispal

result = mult(2, 3)
print(result) # Output: 6

result = add(2, 3)
print(result) # Output: 5



## Testing

The `unittest` module is used to run the tests. To run the tests, run the following command in your terminal:

python -m unittest testmodule.py
